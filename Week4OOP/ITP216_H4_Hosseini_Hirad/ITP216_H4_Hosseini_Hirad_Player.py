# Description:
# Describe what this program does in your own words such as:
'''
This program is a very elementary emulation of an arcane-themed game (such as World of Warcraft) which utilizes newly learned
concepts underlying inheritance. There is a master class of Player which is inherited for two subclasses called Wizard and Barbarian.
The user can elect the character types and customize them before observing them in combat.
